Minishell is a custom shell project developed as part of the 42Network curriculum. This lightweight shell provides a hands-on experience in system programming, including process creation, command execution, and signal handling in Unix-like environments. The project involved implementing core shell functionalities such as parsing user input, executing commands, and managing process control, offering a practical understanding of operating system concepts and C programming.

Key Features
Command Parsing: Efficiently parses and executes user commands.
Process Management: Handles process creation, execution, and signal handling.
Custom Built-ins: Includes essential built-in commands for a functional shell environment.
Signal Handling: Implements robust signal handling for improved process control.
This project was a valuable opportunity to deepen my understanding of low-level system operations and enhance my skills in C programming.
